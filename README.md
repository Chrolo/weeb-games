# weeb-games
_now in javascript!_

a rebuild [Goshi's weeb games](https://github.com/goshinbi/weeb-games) in javascript, because it's what I know.

## Installation instructions:
 1. Make sure you have NodeJS and npm installed on your system
 2. Clone this repo.
 3. run `npm install`
 4. run `npm start`
    - the server is now running and it says what port in the console.
